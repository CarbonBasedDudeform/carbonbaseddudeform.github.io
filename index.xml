      <description>What A Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system developed by Edward Lorenz. It&amp;rsquo;s related to the butterfly effect as the image it produces resembles a butterfly and the idea behind it gives rise to the idea that a butterfly flapping it&amp;rsquo;s wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in the US. More accurately, it&amp;rsquo;s an example of a system where tiny changes or errors in the process cause completely different outcomes.</description>

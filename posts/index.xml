      <description>Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s 没不？ To be or not to be? To 是 or 不是， or is it to 有 or 没有？ 不有？&#xA;As part of my efforts to learn Mandarin, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain 不 (bu) and 没 (méi).&#xA;有 - yǒu - to have or to exist. Essentially, 有 means &amp;ldquo;to have&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;to exist,&amp;rdquo; while 没有 means &amp;ldquo;to not have&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;to not exist.&amp;rdquo; The character 没 negates 有, making it the negative form.</description>

      <description>What is an expression? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of code that returns a value, something like&#xA;int i = 0; Here an expression returns a variable, i, with a value of 0.

      <title>Making a Lorenz Attractor in go</title>

      <description>What A Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system developed by Edward Lorenz. It&amp;rsquo;s related to the butterfly effect as the image it produces resembles a butterfly and the idea behind it gives rise to the idea that a butterfly flapping it&amp;rsquo;s wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in the US. More accurately, it&amp;rsquo;s an example of a system where tiny changes or errors in the process cause completely different outcomes.</description>

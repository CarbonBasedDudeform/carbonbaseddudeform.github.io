      <description>What is an expression? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of code that returns a value, something like&#xA;int i = 0; Here an expression returns a variable, i, with a value of 0. Expressions can be literals, like 0, or variables, like i, but they can also be references, pointers, etc. Values are defined by two independent properties:&#xA;has identity can be moved What are the value categories? Before C++11, there were L values and R values.</description>

      <description>What A Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system developed by Edward Lorenz. It&amp;rsquo;s related to the butterfly effect as the image it produces resembles a butterfly and the idea behind it gives rise to the idea that a butterfly flapping it&amp;rsquo;s wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in the US. More accurately, it&amp;rsquo;s an example of a system where tiny changes or errors in the process cause completely different outcomes.</description>
